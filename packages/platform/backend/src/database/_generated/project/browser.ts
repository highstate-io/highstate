 * Model ApiKey
 * The API key provides authentication tokens for accessing the platform API.

 * there is the ownership/usage concept to track which entities produce or use the artifact.

 * Model InstanceEvaluationState
 * The evaluation state tracks the result of evaluating composite instances to produce virtual instances.
 * 
 * Composite instances are template components that generate other instances (virtual instances) when evaluated.
 * The evaluation process executes the composite's create function with resolved inputs to produce a tree
 * of child instances. These virtual instances exist in the source "virtual" state and can be units
 * (mapping to Pulumi resources) or other composites (producing more virtual instances recursively).
 * 
 * Evaluation happens automatically after project unlock and library reloads to keep virtual instances
 * synchronized with their composite definitions. Evaluation state persists the produced instance model
 * and tracks success/error status with descriptive messages showing the instance tree or error details.

 * Secrets persist through normal destroy (recreate) operations
 * and are only deleted when explicitly forgetting instance state with the deleteSecrets flag or when manually deleted.
 * 
 * Secret updates invalidate instance input hashes via inputHashNonce, triggering re-execution

 * to decrypt their specific AGE identity, which then decrypts the master key.
 * 
 * Multiple unlock methods can exist per project, allowing different authentication paths
 * to the same encrypted database. When unlock methods are added/removed, the master key
 * is re-encrypted for the new set of recipients.
 * 
 * The encryptedIdentity contains the AGE identity encrypted with the user's authentication
 * method (password-derived key or WebAuthn), while the recipient is the public key

/**
 * Model Worker
 * The worker represents a containerized application that extends unit capabilities beyond Pulumi execution.
 * 
 * Workers enable units to perform runtime operations after Pulumi program completion,
 * such as attaching custom statuses, monitoring resources, or triggering unit reconfigurations.
 * Since Pulumi programs cannot affect instances after execution, workers bypass this limitation
 * by providing persistent runtime behavior.
 * 
 * The worker identity (fully qualified image name) indicates the same publisher/party and services as natural authentication mechanism.
 * All versions of a worker share the same service account, meaning they operate over
 * the same resources and have the same access scope within the platform.

 * Model WorkerVersion

 * when no longer referenced by any unit registrations.
 * 
 * Each version has its own API key for isolation, but all versions of a worker
 * share the same service account and thus the same access scope within the platform.

 * includes parameters passed to the worker for unit-specific configuration.
 * 
 * Registrations are managed during operation execution - created when units declare workers
